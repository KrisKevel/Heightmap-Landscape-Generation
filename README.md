# Heightmap Landscape Generation

## Heightmap Generation
<insert build/run instructions here>


## Importing newly created heightmap into Unreal Engine project
Our project uses Unreal Engine version 4.25.4.

In the editor create a new level for the new landscape (File -> New Level). In the new level, select Landscape mode (Modes -> Landscape). On the left side, select Import from File and find the newly created heightmap from the file browser. Once selected, click import. To add our material to the new landscape, drag "AutoGroundMaterial_Inst" from the Materials folder to the selected landscape on the right.
